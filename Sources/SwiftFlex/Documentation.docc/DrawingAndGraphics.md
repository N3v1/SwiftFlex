## Overview

You create rich, dynamic user interfaces with the built-in views and Shapes that SwiftFlex provides. To enhance any view, you can apply many of the graphical effects typically associated with a graphics context, like setting colors, adding masks, and creating composites.

When you need the flexibility of immediate mode drawing in a graphics context, use a SFCanvas view. This can be particularly helpful when you want to draw an extremely large number of dynamic shapes â€” for example, to create particle effects.
