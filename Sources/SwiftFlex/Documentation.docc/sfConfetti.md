## Overview

@Row {

        SFConfetti is a captivating and user-friendly effect from the SwiftFlex library, specifically designed for SwiftUI. It offers an easy way to integrate and customize confetti animations in your SwiftUI projects. With SFConfetti, you can add a touch of celebration and engagement to your app by creating delightful confetti explosions.
        
        
        > Important:
        > SFConfetti originated from [ConfettiSwiftUI](https://github.com/simibac/ConfettiSwiftUI/tree/master) (MIT) by [Simon Bachmann](https://github.com/simibac).

        ### Features
        - Built with pure SwiftUI: SFConfetti is seamlessly integrated into SwiftUI, ensuring compatibility and a native feel.
        - Shape Variety: Choose from default confetti shapes or inject emojis as text for a personalized and expressive touch.
        - Customizable Explosion: Easily configure the radius and angles of the confetti explosion to achieve the desired visual effect.
        - State Triggered Animation: Initiate the animation with a single state change and reuse it multiple times for an interactive experience.

### Usage
1. Import SFConfetti: Begin by importing SwiftFlex into every Swift file where you intend to use SFConfetti.
2. Configure with State Variable: Define an integer as a state variable (counter in the example). Any change to this variable will trigger a new confetti animation.
3. Call `.sfConfettiCannon(counter: Binding<Int>)` on your Button

```swift
import SwiftFlex
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    
    @State private var counter:  Int = 0
    
    var body: some View {
        Button("ðŸŽ‰") {
            counter += 1
        }
        .sfConfettiCannon(counter: $counter)
    }
}
```
