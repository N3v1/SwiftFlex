## Overview

The most common way to present a view hierarchy in your app’s interface is with a `WindowGroup`, which produces a platform-specific behavior and appearance.

On platforms that support it, people can open multiple windows from the group simultaneously. Each window relies on the same root view definition, but retains its own view state. On some platforms, you can also supplement your app’s user interface with a single-instance window using the Window scene type.
