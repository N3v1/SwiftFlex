# ``SwiftFlex``

Enhance your Swift coding journey with SwiftFlex, providing an extensive range of UI elements to macros for a versatile development experience.

## Overview

SwiftFlex provides views, controls and improved layout structures for declaring your app's user interface. The framework provides improved event handlers for delevering taps, gestures, and the other types of input to your app, and tools to manage the flow of data from your apps models down to the views and controls that users see and interact with.

Use our comprehensive libary in SwiftUI views for displaying shapes using stacks, lists, and more. Apply powerful modifiers to built-in views and your own views to customize their rendering and interactivity. Share code between apps on multiple platforms with views and controls that adapt to their context and presentation.
